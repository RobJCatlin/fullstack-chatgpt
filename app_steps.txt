Set up the React front-end:

Create a new React project using a tool like Create React App.
Implement the game logic for Connect 4, allowing two players to take turns dropping chips into a grid.
Use React components to build the UI for the game, including a display for the grid and a form for players to enter their usernames.
Add authentication:

Use a library like PassportJS to handle user authentication on the server-side.
Implement a sign-up and sign-in form for players to create and log into their accounts.
Store hashed passwords and associated usernames in MongoDB.
Connect the front-end and back-end:

Use a tool like Axios to send HTTP requests from the React front-end to the server-side.
Implement APIs on the server-side to handle user authentication and game data, such as storing and retrieving the state of the Connect 4 game.
Connect the React front-end to the MongoDB database using a library like Mongoose to retrieve and store user data.
Deploy the app:

Deploy the React front-end and server-side to a hosting platform like Heroku or AWS.
Set up a MongoDB database, either by using a managed service like MongoDB Atlas or by deploying it on a separate server.
